# rust-centric clone of nanochat/rustbpe

See: [nanochat rustbpe](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/tree/master/rustbpe)

This repo aims to be a rust-first *BPETokenizer* library;
focusing on performance and ease of use as a first-class rust crate.

Python bindings already exist for `nanochat/rustbpe`.

## Status: Incomplete

I am incrementally porting features from `nanochat/rustbpe` to this crate;
while cleaning up the rust mechanics, and writing full tests and docs.

This is complete up to the `Word/PairIndex` machinery.
